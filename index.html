                      <p><i>With my background in Computer Engineering and leadership activities, I approach any given task with a practical toolset of knowledge, critical thinking, and persistence which allows me to thrive in its completion.</i></p>
                      <p>I’m Thomas Dedinsky, a Software Development Engineer 2 at Amazon working with big data real-time streaming technologies. I'm a graduate from the University of Waterloo with a BaSC in Computer Engineering and a minor in Combinatorics and Optimization. I've worked software development jobs in the past at Intel, Qualcomm, Infinera, Veeva, DND, and Bayer, and have expertise in many languages including C/C++, Javascript, Python, Java, and more. I spent almost a decade moderating the Discord and Reddit communities of TwitchPlaysPokemon, and helping organize and run the Future Aces Leadership Conference, with lots of involvement in my school's Engineering Society. I'm an aspiring leader and computer engineer with lots of experience in both fronts!</p>

                  <h4>Software Development Engineer 2 - Amazon</h4>
                  <p>I'm designing brand new systems for tracking delivery driver performance, not based off of our previous functionality, requiring associating data-incomplete real-time signals with many-to-many relationships. Besides deep-diving and deciding on scalable and maintainable multi-service architecture, designed for currently visible features and future expansion, I'm also creating comprehensive task by task overviews of current feature implementation for multiple sub-leads. I'm proactively reaching out to business members, senior software engineers, and other service owners, to avoid roadblockers and build comprehensive intersystem knowledge to avoid post-implementation redesigns. This is on top of the previous responsibilities of SDE 1.</p>

                  <h4>Software Development Engineer 1 - Amazon</h4>
                  <p>I successfully designed architecture, coded end-to-end functionality, created data quality tools, iteratively analyzed and fixed discrepancies, and launched parts of our brand new data performance engine. This engine processes billions of signals per day, and the redesign shrinks the latency from 37 hours to 15 minutes. This is using real-time processing of these signals, using many big data technologies powered by Apache (Flink, Spark, Hadoop) and AWS (Kinesis, ECS, EMR). I also was an end-to-end owner of this engine, being a top coder in the team, being the primary owner of production pipeline maintenance, and orchestrating investigations with reported production issues. I also spent lots of time collaborating with business partners on features and data requests, and teammates with issue investigation and system knowledge sharing.</p>

                      <p>I helped develop the DDRT protocol for memory units implemented in Intel’s Stratix 10 FPGAs and Optane Persistent Memory units. The main task I had was implementing the AXI4 interface protocol to account for a proprietary hardware change, which involved modification of a lot of TCL and pin layout files to connect all of the components together. Additionally, I fixed some issues by debugging Verilog and spent a lot of time on test verification to prevent regression.</p>

I also responded to customer's requests and made customized code for their hospital as well as tested and made sure our software ran properly on and upgraded to our supported operating systems. I did this by creating and maintaining 4 servers running virtual machines of various Linux versions and utilizing Jenkins to run and develop automated tests.</p>

Competitors this year were tasked with creating an artificial intelligence which controlled a specialized autonomous cleaner, tasked to clean a semi-formal eatery in an efficient manner. I focused on making the challenge language-agnostic by creating an API server for competitors to interact with, as well as easy to comprehend for judges and beta testers, achieved by providing an interactive visual during the presentation phase. There was also focus on creating an engineering problem rather than just a programming problem, a design philosophy that made this simultaneous location and mapping problem have flexibility of solution approach with ambiguity of a "correct" path, made the solution is dependent as opposed to an isolated product, and made the challenge easy to complete but hard to optimize.</p>
