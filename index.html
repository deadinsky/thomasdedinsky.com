                      <p>I’m Thomas Dedinsky, a student at the University of Waterloo who is a candidate for a BaSC in Computer Engineering. I've worked software development jobs in the past at Infinera, Veeva, DND, and Bayer, and have expertise in many languages including Javascript, Java, C++, Python, and more. I was previously the VP Academic for Waterloo's Engineering Society 'A' while also carrying various positions with EngSoc, as well as a group leader and rec advisor with the Herbert H. Carniege Future Aces Foundation, where I helped run their Future Aces Conference every year. My current focus is on my studies abroad, as currently I'm on exchange at the University of Technology of Compiègne in France, strengthening my french language and multicultural skills while also enjoying a whole new experience. I'm an aspiring leader and computer engineer with lots of experience in both fronts!</p>

Additionally, I improved an offline resource and utility app designed for Canadian troops in Latvia by creating a content manager system to allow code-illiterate personnel to repurpose the application. Both apps, R2MR and CAT, were endorsed by the General of Canada. Worked in a hybrid development environment, releasing both on Android and iOS using Ember.js and Cordova.</p>

I spearheaded the development of an increasingly requested, but complicated multi-modality feature, which replaced the previously hack-jobbed system with sustainable code. I also responded to customer's requests and made customized code for their hospital as well as tested and made sure our software ran properly on and upgraded to our supported operating systems. I did this by creating and maintaining 4 servers running virtual machines of various Linux versions and utilizing Jenkins to run and develop automated tests.</p>

                      <p>I created the code that powered the Canadian Engineering Competition 2019 programming competition. Competitors this year were tasked with creating an artificial intelligence which controlled a specialized autonomous cleaner, tasked to clean a semi-formal eatery in an efficient manner. I focused on making the challenge language-agnostic by creating an API server for competitors to interact with, as well as easy to comprehend for judges and beta testers, achieved by providing an interactive visual during the presentation phase. There was also focus on creating an engineering problem rather than just a programming problem, a design philosophy that made this simultaneous location and mapping problem have flexibility of solution approach with ambiguity of a "correct" path, made the solution is dependent as opposed to an isolated product, and made the challenge easy to complete but hard to optimize.</p>

                      <p>I created a working model of dielectric fields using inputted graphs and calculated intermediate values by converting the field into a series of linear equations and using appropriate numerical method techniques. This was done as part of an Undergraduate Research Assistantship under Professor Nasser Abukhdeir of the Chemical Engineering department. I worked under him and with his graduate student team and researched several research papers and electrostatics textbooks based on assigned tasks in addition to developing this code.</p>

                      <p>I acted as an elected representative of the Engineering student body population. I attend various committees with other faculty executives and staff members advocating on behalf of the collective opinions of students and from EngSoc council-mandated stances. I also headed some academic and co-op initiatives, such as leading the drive and implementation of strengthened co-op injury and near miss policy, compiling and presenting a thorough report regarding relative ranking in assignment grading, and improving the functionality of the exam bank website by revamping the theme and submissions.</p>

                      <h4>Group Leader - Herbert H. Carnegie Future Aces Foundation</h4>
                      <p>I helped run a yearly, 3-day, 200-delegate conference dedicated to empowering youth by helping them find the leader within them. I worked both before the event with preparing it and during the event, by helping create delegation groups, running various leadership workshops, and contacting guest speakers. I have been both a group leader, working directly with a small 15-person group throughout the conference, and as a rec advisor, organizing the activities the whole conference went through during the weekend.</p>
